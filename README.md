  Pastel To-Do List with Toasts
A single-page, Pinterest-vibe To-Do app built for aesthetics and simplicity.  
Users can **add**, **mark complete**, and **delete** tasks—with gentle toast notifications confirming each action.

What I Learned
- How to create lightweight, functional UI feedback using vanilla JS toast/snackbar pattern—no library overwhelm.
- Toggling CSS classes for task completion while keeping UX tone soft and intuitive.
- Crafting layouts and fonts for balance between Pinterest aesthetic and legibility.

Favorite Feature
The **toast notifications** were the most rewarding to build—small pop-ups ("Task added", "Task deleted", etc.) that feel polished yet unobtrusive.
They give a subtle nod to modern UI expectations, without stealing the show.

 What I’d Add Next
- Save tasks in **localStorage** so they persist across sessions.
- Add **inline editing**—click task text to edit quickly.
- Give toast messages a **fade/slide animation**
